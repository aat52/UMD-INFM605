For this component of your grade, you will chose to lead a weekly module during the semester by preparing a presentation summarizing the readings (approximately 20-25 slides in length) and leading the online discussion via ELMS by posting 2-3 question prompts to stimulate class discussion and moderating the discussion throughout the week. Your summary and discussion prompts must be posted in the designated location on ELMS by Friday @ 1:00 PM prior to the week in which you are signed up. Your slides should: (1) Provide a summary of key points in the reading/ readings (15-20 slides of 3-5 bullet points each), (2) Describe one or more connections among the readings for the week or between this week's readings and past weeksâ€™ readings (3-5 slides of 3-5 bullet points each), (4) Conclude with 1 slide of 2-3 thought provoking questions to stimulate discussion for the upcoming week.
