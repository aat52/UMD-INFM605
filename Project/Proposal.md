# Project Proposal
Groups will choose a collection of people in a particular context (e.g., call center operators, Starbuck’s regulars, iPhone or Facebook users, janitors,...). They need to be people that you will have easy access to, since you will be “studying” them using some of the methods we will discuss in class (e.g., interviews, focus groups, user studies,...). You will study their work (or play) practices in order to understand some of their underlying information needs, and then come up with some recommendations on how to better meet those needs.  The first step you will have as a group is to choose a set of users to study. Next, you will create a proposal that will outline what you plan on doing, what the purpose of your study will be, and how you will accomplish your goals. 

You can think of the group project as a consulting project where an outside company or organization is funding the work. Of course, in reality you will not be paid for your work and you may not be working with some outside organization, but for purposes of this assignment you should act as if you were. Your proposal should be written for two audiences: those for whom you are conducting the work (real or imaginary) and your own 
team who will use it as a blueprint for what you will do to accomplish the work. Use language that is easy to understand, even for people not familiar with user studies. If you are working with a real organization, you will need to negotiate the specific focus and scope of your project and the schedule BEFORE you turn in this assignment! In total, the  proposal will likely be between 2 and 4 pages single spaced.  

The following elements must be incorporated into your proposal, although the proposal does not need to follow the same organization as what is listed here:
1. Summary of the project. At the beginning of your paper, provide a one-paragraph abstract that summarizes the entire project. [Hint: you may want to write this last, after you have figured out exactly what you will be doing and when] 1 point

2. Intro & Background. Introduce the project in a broader context. If you are working with an organization or collection of people, describe who they are, what is important to them, what they do, and how they relate to others (e.g., competitors). If you are proposing or evaluating a specific information technology or process describe its purpose, how it is or is expected to be used, how it compares with other related technologies or processes. 1 point
 
3. Project Goals & Questions. Discuss the goals of your project: What do you hope to learn? Why is it important to learn it? What questions will your study answer? 1 point  
 
4. Work Plan. Describe how you will accomplish your goals and answer your research questions. What specific methods will you use? Why have you chosen each one and what do you hope to learn from them? [Hint: Make sure you don’t choose too many methods 
that you don’t have time to accomplish each one. Choose somewhere between 2 and 4 methods, depending on how involved they each are.] For each method, talk about your plan to collect data, your plans for recruitment, what you will actually do, and how you’ll analyze the data. Convince the readers that you know what you’re talking about by including enough details, but don’t overdue the amount of detail. 1 point

5. Schedule and Project Management. Provide a schedule that outlines when you will work on and accomplish various tasks and milestones. Describe who will perform the various tasks (i.e., which team members) and estimate how many hours they will take. Make sure and balance the work so that each team member will share the workload (but feel free to take on specific roles based on your individual skills). You may want to create a Gantt chart to summarize your schedule and work plan. Also include a description of how team members will coordinate their activities (e.g., what technologies you will use to contact each other, if you’ll have regularly scheduled meetings. 1 point

These are the kinds of things I want you to include in your proposal. Remember, this is a great opportunity to get feedback to improve your final project, so the more detail you include in your proposal, the better the feedback will be.


### Feedback: 
This is a great topic and plan. With that said, I would narrow the set of users to UMD students who use Instagram (or something similar). Your current topic of all users is very broad and not achievable within a semester. Let me know if you have any questions.
