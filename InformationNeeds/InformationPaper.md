# Information Needs and Seeking Paper

Humans often search for information in order to fulfill some type of need. Although we all search for information as part of our daily lives, we don’t often reflect upon the process itself. This assignment will help you answer these questions for yourself and others. It will force you to see the world as an “informationist” does. This will, in turn help you to improve your own search behaviors, as well as understand how to design effective information systems and information management practices. The assignment will also give you practice in interviewing, synthesizing ideas, writing, and applying theory to real-world experience.

**Instructions:**

This is an assignment where you may interview a person of your choosing (this may be a family member, friend, classmate, or colleague) that has a complex information need that they have very recently faced. For example, finding a place to live, choosing a graduate school to attend, locating a good doctor, purchasing a new computer, fixing a broken dryer, etc. Next, you will conduct an interview (taking detailed notes of the encounter) to find out how they tried to meet their information needs. Questions to consider in the interview include (but are not limited to): How and why did they search for information? What sources did they use? What biases did they have? When did they know when to stop searching? How did they feel during the process? What strategies did they utilize? How did interactions with others influence their search? What role did technology play in their search? Take your time, ask general and detailed questions, and repeat back your understanding to make sure it is correct. Your interview may take up to an hour and should certainly take more than 30 minutes.

 
Finally, you will need to write up your analysis in a 6-8 page, double spaced paper.  Carefully describe the individual’s underlying information need. Use the rest of the paper to analyze that information need. Make sure and use concepts from the readings we have covered so far and reference them appropriately. The bulk of the paper should be on the analysis rather than just describing what your interviewee did.

Your paper must include the following sections (be sure to put headings for each section: (1) introduction (reference general theories or content about how users access information and user needs) (2.5 points), (2) Methods (describe details of the interview method and analysis, citing the course readings/literature) (5 points) (2) interview findings (description of your interview and the specific information need) (5 points), (3) discussion (analyze and present your findings using frameworks in and citing course readings) (10 points) and (4) conclusions and recommendations (2.5 points).

Assessment: This assignment is graded based on evidence that you have read the required readings and accurately described concepts relevant to this assignment; evidence of critical thinking; connections among/ between readings are original, clearly stated and relevant adherence to the length, formatting, and citation requirements; and clarity and precision of thought in your writing.
